How do I install ``htcondor-jobs``?
-----------------------------------

On Unix/Linux systems, running ``pip install htcondor-jobs`` from the command line should suffice.

* To get the latest development version of ``htcondor-jobs``, run ``pip install git+https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-jobs.git`` instead.
* Run ``pip install git+https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-jobs.git@<branch>`` to install a specific branch.
